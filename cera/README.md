# CERA Workspace

This directory is an isolated workspace for the CERA line of work, separate from the existing Event-VLM artifacts.

## Naming lock

- Official method name: `CERA`
- Expansion: `Causal Event Reasoning and Attribution`
- Internal shorthand for modules/objectives: `CER`

## Structure

- `paper/`: ECCV paper draft seed for CERA
- `notes/`: kickoff and decision notes

## Next immediate tasks

1. Rewrite abstract/introduction wording to consistently reflect CERA framing.
2. Rename figure/table labels that still encode old naming assumptions.
3. Decide whether to keep `CERA-Core` / `CERA-Full` variant names.
