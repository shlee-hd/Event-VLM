# CERA Workspace

This directory is an isolated workspace for CERA.
The active paper draft is a clean-room restart from the CERA keyword only.

## Naming lock

- Official method name: `CERA`
- Expansion: `Causal Event Reasoning and Attribution`
- Internal shorthand for modules/objectives: `CER`

## Structure

- `paper/`: active clean-room CERA draft and snapshots
- `archive/`: archived seed materials from earlier migrated drafts
- `experiments/`: CERA-specific experiment config seeds
- `notes/`: kickoff and decision notes
- `scripts/`: workspace guardrails (e.g., naming checks)

## Next immediate tasks

1. Execute external-server run matrix with protocol lock (`cera/experiments/PROTOCOL_LOCK.md`).
2. Replace projected paper blocks with measured tables using swap markers in `cera/paper/main.tex`.
3. Finalize camera-ready polish (wording, stats report, snapshot versioning).
