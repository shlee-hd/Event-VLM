# CERA Kickoff

- Date: 2026-02-18
- Context: Create a new CERA-focused workspace separated from Event-VLM preparation area.

## Decisions

- Main acronym: `CERA`
- Expansion: `Causal Event Reasoning and Attribution`
- Internal short term: `CER` (for component/objective naming)

## Created today

- New isolated directory: `cera/`
- Paper seed copied from current baseline:
  - `cera/paper/main.tex`
  - `cera/paper/main.bib`
- Initial naming migration in `cera/paper/main.tex`:
  - `Event-VLM` -> `CERA`
  - `Event-VLM-Core` -> `CERA-Core`
  - `Event-VLM-Full` -> `CERA-Full`
  - Abstract first mention expanded to full acronym phrase
