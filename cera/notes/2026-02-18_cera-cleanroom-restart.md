# CERA Clean-room Restart

- Date: 2026-02-18
- Decision: restart CERA manuscript from scratch using only the CERA keyword framing.

## Actions

- Moved prior migrated paper workspace to:
  - `cera/archive/paper_seed_eventvlm_2026-02-18/`
- Recreated active paper workspace:
  - `cera/paper/main.tex` (fresh skeleton)
  - `cera/paper/main.bib` (empty seed)
  - `cera/paper/versions/v0/` snapshot

## Guideline

Do not pull prose from archived seed into the active CERA draft.
