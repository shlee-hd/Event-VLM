# Artifact Registry

Canonical registry for experiment outputs promoted to paper-facing evidence.

| Artifact ID | Date | Run ID | File | Hash/Size | Purpose | Used In |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ART-001 | 2026-02-17 | RUN-001 | `outputs/multi_seed_eval/summary.json` | pending | multi-seed aggregate metrics | main tables |
| ART-002 | 2026-02-17 | RUN-001 | `outputs/multi_seed_eval/summary.md` | pending | human-readable summary | reviewer sync |

## Rule
- If a number enters the paper, its source artifact must be listed here first.
