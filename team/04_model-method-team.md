# Model and Method Team

## Mission
- Strengthen method novelty and technical defensibility.

## Responsibilities
- design and refine core method blocks.
- propose high-leverage ablations and counterfactuals.
- stress-test assumptions and identify brittle regimes.
- maintain method-to-code-to-paper consistency.

## Required Deliverables
- method change note (what changed, why, expected effect).
- ablation design matrix before execution.
- failure hypothesis list before major run batches.

## Handshake with Experiment Team
- provide exact config deltas for each hypothesis.
- define stop criteria for "claim accepted/rejected".

## Handshake with Reviewer Team
- pre-review equations and notation before major text updates.
