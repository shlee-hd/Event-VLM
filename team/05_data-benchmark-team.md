# Data and Benchmark Team

## Mission
- Ensure benchmark strategy is broad, fair, and reviewer-resilient.

## Responsibilities
- maintain dataset protocol definitions.
- verify split integrity and annotation assumptions.
- propose additional benchmark datasets/tasks when claims widen.
- define baseline parity policy and dagger/non-dagger reporting rules.

## Deliverables
- benchmark coverage table (dataset, task, metric, limitation).
- baseline implementation status (reproduced vs paper-reported).
- protocol drift alerts (if configs or runtime settings diverge).

## Quality Constraints
- no mixed data protocol in a single headline claim.
- every benchmark claim must state scope and boundary.
