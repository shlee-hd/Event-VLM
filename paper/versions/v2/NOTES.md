# v2 Notes

This snapshot captures the claim-polished Draft V1 state before evidence-hardening.

Focus of this version:
- maximize clarity and persuasiveness of the 3-axis claim
- keep method story coherent from abstract to conclusion
- preserve appendices while preparing for stronger experimental rigor in the next version
