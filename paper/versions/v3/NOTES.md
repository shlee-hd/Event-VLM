# v3 Notes

This snapshot captures the evidence-hardening revision after v2 claim polishing.

Focus of this version:
- improve reviewer trust with cleaner review metadata and explicit fairness protocol
- separate `Event-VLM-Core` vs `Event-VLM-Full` to remove metric ambiguity
- strengthen experimental readability with component-wise figure integration
- add appendix-level reproducibility checklist and failure taxonomy

Known remaining gaps:
- multi-seed confidence intervals are still pending
- some LaTeX overfull warnings remain and can be polished later
