# v4 Notes

This snapshot captures the claim-beautification pass focused on evidence clarity.

Focus of this version:
- added explicit cross-dataset evidence on XD-Violence under the same runtime protocol
- added quality-retention table to directly support the "~99% quality" claim
- added draft-scope statistical sufficiency statement in main text and release protocol in appendix
- reduced major table-width formatting issues and recompiled cleanly with local TinyTeX

Known remaining gaps:
- full multi-seed confidence intervals and significance tests are still pending final release
- several minor overfull/underfull warnings remain but do not block PDF generation
