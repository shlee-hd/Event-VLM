# Paper Versioning

This directory stores immutable snapshots of the paper by version.

## Rules
- `vN/` contains the exact `main.tex`, `main.bib`, and compiled PDF for that version.
- Top-level convenience PDFs follow: `Event-VLM-paper-vN.pdf`.
- Each version should include an entry in `paper/versions/CHANGELOG.md`.
