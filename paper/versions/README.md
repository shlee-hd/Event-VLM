# Paper Versioning

This directory stores immutable snapshots of the paper by version.

## Rules
- `vN/` contains the exact `main.tex`, `main.bib`, and compiled PDF for that version.
- Top-level convenience PDFs follow: `Event-VLM-paper-vN.pdf`.
- Each version should include an entry in `paper/versions/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Current versions
- `v0`: initial baseline draft PDF (`paper/Event-vlm-paper-v0.pdf`)
- `v1`: first full draft PDF (`paper/Event-VLM-paper-v1.pdf`)
- `v2`: claim-polished Draft V1 snapshot (`paper/versions/v2/`)
