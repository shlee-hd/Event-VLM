# v8 Notes

This snapshot captures post-v7 polish after reviewer hardening.

Focus of this version:
- refined related-work and results prose for readability and tighter review flow
- tightened claim-evidence traceability table wording to reduce layout fragility
- recompiled and verified clean log state (no overfull/underfull/layout warnings)
- retained v7 reviewer-hardening additions (stress protocols, complexity assumptions, traceability map)

Build status:
- local TinyTeX compile succeeded (`paper/build/main.pdf`)
- no layout warning lines found in latest `paper/build/main.log`
