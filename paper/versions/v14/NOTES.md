# v14 Notes

Date: 2026-02-18

## What changed
- Preserved the v13 evidence structure and applied reviewer-fair, claim-conservative wording refinements in `paper/main.tex`.
- Introduction/contribution phrasing was tightened to keep pilot-scope claims explicit and avoid overreach.
- Related work wording was simplified for readability without changing citation scope.
- XD-Violence interpretation sentence was narrowed to `explanation-capable models in this setting` for stricter fairness.
- Appendix qualitative PPE example text was shortened for clearer risk phrasing.

## Validation
- PASS: `bash scripts/build_paper.sh`
- Output: `/Users/shlee/codex/2026/eccv2026/paper/build/main.pdf`

## Server-dependent items
- No new experiments were run because the experiment server is currently unavailable.
- Statistical/benchmark expansion execution remains ready via existing v12-v13 scripts once server access is restored.
