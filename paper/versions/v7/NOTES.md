- strengthened stress-test reproducibility specification in main experiments section
- clarified decoding speedup approximation boundaries (exact form + asymptotic regime)
- added stream-capacity computation definition in main text
- added appendix derivation block for decoding complexity assumptions
- added claim-to-evidence traceability table for fast reviewer verification

Build status:
- local TinyTeX compile succeeded (`paper/build/main.pdf`, 23 pages)
