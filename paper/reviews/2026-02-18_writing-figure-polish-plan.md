# Writing & Figure Polish Plan (2026-02-18)

Status: IN_PROGRESS
Owner: Writing & Figure Team

## Objective
- Make argument flow and visual communication reviewer-friendly in first pass.

## Writing Tasks
- [ ] Abstract: keep single-sentence headline tightly bound to one table cluster.
- [ ] Introduction: ensure problem pressure and method necessity are explicit in first page.
- [ ] Conclusion: prevent scope creep beyond pilot evidence.

## Figure/Table Tasks
- [ ] verify every caption states "what to read first" and "why it matters".
- [ ] ensure each figure/table is referenced in adjacent text with claim linkage.
- [ ] ensure table density remains readable under printed two-column view.

## Layout Quality Gate
- [ ] no overflow warnings in `paper/build/main.log`.
- [ ] no ambiguous axis/unit labels.
- [ ] no redundant visual elements.

## Deliverable
- concise change list with before/after snippets and file line references.
