# Method Consistency Check (2026-02-18, v13)

Status: TODO  
Owner: Model & Method Team

## Scope
- Method section equations and symbol usage in `paper/main.tex`
- Consistency with code-level assumptions in `src/` and `experiments/`

## Required Checks
- [ ] notation completeness (`\sigma_{\text{shape}}`, `TopKIdx`, thresholds, budgets).
- [ ] complexity statements match algorithmic description.
- [ ] stage-by-stage method claims align with ablation table definitions.
- [ ] no hidden dependency on unavailable server artifacts for method validity.

## Findings and Fixes
- (fill here)

## Sign-off
- [ ] APPROVED
- [ ] CHANGES REQUIRED
