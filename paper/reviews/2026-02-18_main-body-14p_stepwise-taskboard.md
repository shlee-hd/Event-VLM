# 2026-02-18 Main Body 14p Stepwise Taskboard

## Ground Rule
- Work on exactly one micro-task at a time.
- After each micro-task: build PDF, verify, commit.

## Micro Tasks
- [x] T01: Fix Fig.3 aspect ratio source asset (`figure2_components.png`) to reduce vertical footprint.
- [x] T02: Fix Fig.2(a) readability by separating combined figure and restoring a readable standalone frontier figure.
- [ ] T03: Move `tab:axis_gain` from main text to appendix (keep references valid).
- [ ] T04: Move `tab:event_density` from main text to appendix.
- [ ] T05: Move `tab:runtime_robustness` from main text to appendix.
- [ ] T06: Rebuild and check main-body page pressure (target: <=14 pages excluding references).
- [ ] T07: If still over budget, move one additional low-priority table from main to appendix.
- [ ] T08: Version snapshot + changelog update.

## Current Focus
- T03 only: move `tab:axis_gain` to appendix and rebuild.
